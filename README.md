# Distributed Algorithms Simulation (Python)


A research and simulation project implementing coordination, consensus, scheduling, load balancing, fault tolerance, and large-scale data processing algorithms for distributed systems and telecommunication networks.


## Live demo (what's included)


- Lamport Logical Clocks (message ordering)
- Simplified Raft-style Leader Election (election timing, resilience)
- MapReduce (Word Count) using multiprocessing
- Load Balancer simulator (round-robin and least-connections)
- Metrics utilities for measuring latency, throughput, and network efficiency
