## **Overview**

This repository contains the research, implementation, and Python-based simulations of various distributed algorithms commonly used in telecommunications, cloud computing, and large-scale information systems.  

The goal of this project is to:

- Study key classes of distributed algorithms
- Simulate algorithm behavior across multiple nodes/processes
- Measure performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and network efficiency
- Visualize results and analyze implications for scalable, reliable distributed systems

## **Algorithms Implemented**

| Category | Algorithm / Demo | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Consensus** | Raft Leader Election | Simulates multiple nodes electing a leader. Logs votes, messages, and heartbeats. CSV logs are saved for plotting and analysis. |
| **Coordination & Synchronization** | Lamport Timestamps | Demonstrates event ordering across distributed nodes using Lamport clocks. |
| **Scheduling & Load Balancing** | Load Balancer | Round-Robin and Least-Connections task assignment across worker nodes, measuring tasks processed and connection stats. |
| **Large-scale Data Processing** | MapReduce | Simulates distributed map/reduce tasks, logs throughput, and processing time. |
